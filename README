General
=======

This is a module for [ITK](http://itk.org): The Insight Toolkit for Segmentation and
Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4
modular system and  to be places it ITK/Modules/External or uses as a
Remote module.

This modular is empty it is just a template to be used as a starting
point for a module with acutal content.

Getting Started
===============

The official ITKv4 Wiki documentation on adding an external module is here:
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/Modularization/Add_an_external_module_(external_module)
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Policy_and_Procedures_for_Adding_Remote_Modules


External Module
---------------

The following is a breif list of instructions to get a external module
started in a repository:

mkdir ITK/Modules/External/itkMyModule
cd ITK/Modules/External/itkMyModule
git init
git fetch git@github.com:blowekamp/itkExternalTemplate.git
git merge FETCH_HEAD

Remote Module
-------------

After a module has been created as a git repository it can be included
as a remote module, which enables automatic fetching. Add a file in
"ITK/Modules/Remote" called "YourModule.remote.cmake", for this module
it would be "ExternalExample.remote.cmake" with the followlowing contents:

itk_fetch_module(ExternalTemplate
  "A template for a module."
  GIT_REPOSITORY http://github.com/blowekamp/itkExternalTemplate.git
  GIT_TAG master
  )

Editing
-------

The CMakeLists.txt and itk-modules need to be modified with the name
of the module, something along the following:

sed 's/ExternalTemplate/MyModule/g' CMakeLists.txt itk-module.cmake

There is the inplace option to sed, but it's not portable, so do this
change by hand or look up the option in sed.

Then hack away at you code in include, src, and tests.
